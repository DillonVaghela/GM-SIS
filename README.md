## TEAM 31 - GARAGE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Software Engineering Project for Queen Mary University of London. The team had to produce a complete software solution based on a document outlining requirements. Each team member received an individual grade. My **personal grade for the project was 92%**. My personal contribution to the effort was:

1. **Designed Specialist repair centre related classes.**
2. **Helping the project leader [Marcello De Bernadi](https://github.com/marcellodebernardi) with minor issues in the software.**
3.**Help colleagues with their own modules**
